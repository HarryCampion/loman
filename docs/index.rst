Loman
=====

Loman is a Python library to deal with complex dependencies between sets of calculations. You can think of it as make for calculations. By keeping track of the state of your computations, and the dependencies between them, it makes understanding calculation processes easier and allows on-demand full or partial recalculations. This makes it easy to efficiently implement robust real-time and batch systems, as well as providing powerful mechanism for interactive work.
